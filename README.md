# Train Scheduler (Basic + challenge 1)

### Overview

Each train operates during the time between a designated first train departure time and last train operation time. The last operation time is defined in the constant LAST_TRAIN_ARRIVAL_TIME_FOR_A_DAY value. The "next train Arrival time" and the "minutes left" are updated/adjusted every minute accordingly. In otherwords during the time between 
the last train arrival and its first train departure time, each train does not operate. Currently the last train departure time is defined as "23:30."

The appliation is in use of other third party framework or library, such as Â© firebase, Bootstrap, JQuery, moment.js, babel.js, Github.com.
